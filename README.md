# 1D-Signal-Denoiser
This project implements a TensorFlow-based denoising autoencoder for 1D signals. It trains on paired clean and noisy data, learns to remove noise, and reconstructs cleaner signals. Supports per-signal normalization and visualization, suitable for audio, sensor, or time-series denoising tasks.
